# Use GitHub Copilot to write Python

Explore how you can modify a Python repository using code suggestions from GitHub Copilot to create an interactive HTML form and an Application Programming Interface (API) endpoint. By working with this repository, you'll quickly get hands-on with a Python web app that serves an HTTP API that generates a pseudo-random token, commonly used in for identification.

## Requirements

1. Enable your [GitHub Copilot service](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup)
1. Open [this repository with Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-copilot-codespaces-python)

## üí™üèΩ Exercise

The API already has a single endpoint to generate a token. Let's update the API by adding a new endpoint that accepts text and returns a list of tokens.

### üõ† Step 1: Add a Pydantic model

Go to the `main.py` file, and add a comment so that GitHub Copilot can generate a `Pydantic` model for you. The generated model should look like this:

```python
class Text(BaseModel): 

text: str
```

### üîé Step 2: Generate a new endpoint

Next, generate a new endpoint with GitHub Copilot by adding the comment: 

```python
# Create a FastAPI endpoint that accepts a POST request with a JSON body containing a single field called "text" and returns a checksum of the text 
```

### üêç Step 3: Explain code

The `generate()` route creates a pseudo-random token ID using a single line that might be difficult to fully understand. Select the whole function, and then right click on the selection, then select the Copilot menu item, and then the _"Explain This"_ option. The GitHub Copilot chat interface will open to the left and provide you a useful explanation which you can use to interactively ask more questions.

Finally, verify the new endpoint is working by trying it out by going to the `/docs` endpoint and confirming that the endpoint shows up.

üöÄ Congratulations, through the exercise, you haven't only used copilot to generate code but also done it in an interactive and fun way! You can use GitHub Copilot to not only generate code, but write documentation, test your applications and more.

# API Documentation

This API has the following routes:

## POST /checksum

This route accepts a POST request with a JSON body containing a single field called "text".

### Request Body

The request body must be a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
    "text": "string"
}

Running the Application
To run this application, you will need to use the Uvicorn web server, which is a lightning-fast ASGI server built on uvloop and httptools.

First, install the project dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Then, you can start the application with:

uvicorn webapp.main:app --reload
This command will start the server on localhost at port 8000. You can access the application at http://localhost:8000.

About FastAPI
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It's built on top of Starlette for web routing and Pydantic for data validation.

Key features of FastAPI include:

Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).
Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.
Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.
Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration.
Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
